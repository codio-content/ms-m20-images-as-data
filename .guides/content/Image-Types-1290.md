# Most Common File Types

The quality of a digital image is related to the amount or number of pixels used to create the image. A digital image of higher quality will have more pixels as compared to a lower quality image (less pixels). Thus the higher quality image will display an image that looks sharp with smooth transitions. A lower quality image may look blurry or “pixelated” (meaning you can actually see the pixels image when zooming it). 

When storing (or saving) images on a computer or digital device there are several options to choose from. It is important to choose a format that will best work with your needs. Here are a few examples of different formats.

 - JPG/JPEG
 - BMP
 - GIF
 - PNG

JPEG Is the default format that most digital cameras and devices use and most likely the one you are familiar with. Lets look at all the types and when they are used.
