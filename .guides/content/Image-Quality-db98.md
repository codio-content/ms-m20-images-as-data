# Understanding image size and quality
Digital images are made up of millions of tiny pixels (also known as picture elements). Your computer, smartphone, digital device or printer can use these tiny picture elements to display pictures. A computing device will then take these images and turn them into a grid using these things called pixels. The higher quality of the image, the more pixels it represents.

Can you see the small squares when the apple is zoomed in?
The tiny square you see on the circled image are the actual pixels of the image.
