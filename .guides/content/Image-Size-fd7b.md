When taking a picture at a larger file size, more pixels add details and sharpen edges. However there are always size limit. If you begin to enlarge any digital image, the pixels will eventually show - and effect called pixelization, as shown in the image of the apple tree at the beginning.

Remember: The higher the resolution of an image = more pixels in the the image = larger file size. 

Itâ€™s important to remember when saving images you keep in mind quality and size. If you are wanting to share a picture through an email or post on a blog or website, then a lower quality, smaller sized would be appropriate. If you are wanting to print a picture the size of a poster, then a higher resolution would be needed. Storing images also may depend on the device you have. For example you will be able to to store less, high quality images of a 16gb smart phone since larger images take up more space. However, you can store many more low quality images on that same smartphone.
